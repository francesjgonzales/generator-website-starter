# generator-website-starter

This project is about learning how to build an npm package file using website starter files created in my [previous repo](https://github.com/francesjgonzales/website-starter) and generate it using [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) tool

# Steps

1. Create a new repository in github

2. Open a blank VS Code Workspace

3. File structure of yeoman generator
   .
   ├── generator-`generator-name` # File folder has to start with `generator` followed by a dash then your generator name
   │ │ ├── generators
   │ │ │ │ ├── app # Index.js and package files are stored that Yeoman uses to generate
   │ │ │ │ │ │ ├── templates # Package files saved in this folder are generated by Yeoman. Copy files in this folder, alternatively, use `git submodule add 'link of repository'` to load another git repository as a sub folder in the main repository. > Note: If there was a change in original repository, the files in this folder needs to be updated manually
   │ │ ├── index.js #

## How to update a git submodule: Go back to root generator folder and run this `git submodule foreach git pull`

4. Install Yeoman in your project folder
   `npm install --save yeoman-generator`

5. In **index.js**, import yeoman generator and write script files where you need to copy files that are shown in the supposedly generated package file from templates folder. Credits to _Coder Coder_'s for the script.

6. Test the package locally by running this `npm link` and expect a confirmation message that a package is added

> Note: Best to test it in a new blank VS Code Workspace by running an `npm init` then `npm install` and lastly `npm link "name-of-your-generator-folder"` and you will see the package installed.

7. Login to your npm account. Sign up [here](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if you don't have one yet.
   > Note: email address used in sign up is public knowledge.
